  <p>Changes made to the Sage Design System will be reflected as you work and should not be merged until they have been reviewed by another member of the UX Development team.</p>
  <p>Once changes are final the version number should be bumped. This file can be found in: <strong>lib/sage/version.rb</strong></p>
  <p>The last step is to head over to <a href="https://themes.kajabi.com/sage/changelog">https://themes.kajabi.com/sage/changelog</a> and document the changes to the system.</p>
