<h1>Panels and Cards</h1>
<p>
  Panels and Cards are the two most common ways designers and engineers can group content within Sage.

  <h2>Organizing within Sage</h2>
  <p>
    Within Sage we aim to keep our content organized well while avoiding additional unsemantic markup.
    It is always preferrable to use simple structures over complex ones,
    and to use HTML tags as they are intended.
    When it comes to organizing markup such as <code>div</code> and the <code>section</code> tags in particular,
    care should be taken to use each in its intended context.
    When in doubt, <code>div</code> is the preferred default organizer in order to avoid confuscating organization
    with the additional semantics and outlining features of the <code>section</code> tags.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our grid setup and containers provide a baseline for sizing elements
    and displaying them in particular arrangements beside each other.
    But when it comes to visual effects that enhance grouping we have two core categories
    of grouping devices: Panels and Cards.

  <div class="sage-panel sage-spacer-top sage-spacer-bottom">
    <div class="sage-panel__header">
      <h3 class="sage-panel__title">Panel</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="sage-panel__copy sage-type">
      <p>This is a basic panel filling the space available within this page's grid setup.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sage-card">
      <h4 class="t-sage-heading-6">Card</h4>
      <p>This is a basic card filling the space available inside this panel.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Panels</h2>
  <p>
    Panels may be placed on the Stage and present a group of content
    within a raised white background with rounded corners.
  </p>
  <p>
    Panels are very versatile with a number of inner elements useful
    for arranging content as desired.
    These are explained in full detail in the
    <%= link_to "Panel Object", pages_object_path(:panel) %>
    page.
  </p>

  <h2>Cards</h2>
  <p>
    Cards are smaller sets of content placed within Panels that have a solid border,
    rounded corner treatment, and certain internal spacing rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementation of Cards are almost infinite,
    but formally codified configurations are found under Objects
    such as Upload Cards, Data Cards, and Expandable Cards.
    For other one-off implementations the
    <%= link_to "Card Object", pages_object_path(:card) %>
    can be used (ussamedly within a panel).
